## Game Play
To start a new game, simply press the "New Game" button.  You can customize the grid size and number of mines as you wish.

Start clicking around if you dare.  A number revealed on click indicates the number of mines surrounding the square, and a bomb means you weren't so lucky this time.

Once you think you've clicked all non-mines, click "I'm done!"  We'll check if you successfully mined around all the mines.
